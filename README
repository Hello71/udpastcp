This program hides UDP traffic as TCP traffic in order to bypass certain
firewalls.

It is not designed to bypass rigorous deep packet inspection; for example,
there is no window scaling; all data received as UDP will be immediately
transmitted as TCP with a fixed window size. There is also no retransmission,
although that could be implemented (at a detriment to the overall network health).

This program is intended to be C99 and POSIX compatible, and requires only
libev. If desired, it should be easily portable to use libevent instead, as it
uses only basic event-based programming concepts.

Example usage:
    server# openvpn --proto udp --port 1194
    server# udpintcp server localhost 11940 localhost 1194
    client# udpintcp client localhost 1194 server 11940
    client# openvpn --remote localhost 11940 udp
